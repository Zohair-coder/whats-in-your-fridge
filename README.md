# Whats_In_Your_Fridge

CI 102/103 project to create a website to let users input ingredients they have, and will generate a list of recipes containing only the ingredients they currently have. 

To run the app, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Go into the api directory and run `npm install`.
Then go into the client directory and run `npm install`.

Once the dependencies are installed, we can run the app.

Go into the api directory and run `npm start`.
Launch a new terminal and go into the client directory and run `npm start`.

The app should now be running on `localhost:3000`.
